# Neural-Network-Model

# To-Do
- [x] Remember to add ***Bias*** in all layers !!
- [x] Weights update and Gradian Descent

# Questions
- The dimensions of weights array
- The delta-v
- The delta-w
- Draw the figure
- Show the code
- Convergences, Measurements, When to stop?
- The accuracy -> Am I doing it correctly? (/250)
- Why it rises and falls again ? Overfitting ?
